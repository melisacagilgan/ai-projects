# Transfer Learning


## About Project
In this project, I trained a deep learning model using transfer learning on the "Cats and Dogs" dataset. I asked to implement data preprocessing steps and pre-trained model training separately. I read the images in the first part and split them into Training, Validation, and Test Set. Afterward, I applied resizing and normalization to each set. In the second part, I chose the EfficientNet-B5 model to use. We fed the pre-trained model with our training set and controlled the training process with the validation set. Finally, I saved the best model with the highest validation accuracy, tested it with the test set, and analyzed the results.
